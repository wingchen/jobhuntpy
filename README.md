# jobhuntpy

jobhuntpy grab all the open jobs from indeed.com based on the keyword, location your desire, and your linkedin connections.

Often times, you wonder how you can leverage your networking to land on a job you are interested in. So you go to linkedin, 
browse through your friend's companies that you are interested in, and come back to query in indeed.com to see if these 
companies some ideal job openings for you.

Going back and forth between indeed.com and linkein can take up a lot of time. Their web UIs are just not designed for it.
You might end up spending 80% of the time and effort to compile the data into a spreadsheet before you can even analyze
the the companies, job titles, when were they first appeared... etc.

jobhuntpy takes all of these for you. As you will see in the followup sessions, as soon as you provide your linkedin
login credential and other credentials like job keyword, city, and state, it is able to provide you with 2 csv files,
connections.csv and jobs.csv.

connections.csv presents all your linkedin connections, including location, job function and their company information 
in a single sheet, so that you will be able to see who you should go talk to about your job applications.
 
jobs.csv in turn lists all the available jobs on indeed.com in your linkedin friends' companies, filtered by the
location and keyword information you provide. This way, you are able to pinpoint the job opportunities your
friends are able to help you.

The best part of spreadsheets like csv files is that you are now able to filter, sort, and join all the data with your
excellent excel skills.
